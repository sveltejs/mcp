# MCP Server Tools

The MCP server provides these tools for LLM interaction with Svelte documentation:

## Available Tools

**`list-sections`** - Lists all available documentation sections

**`get-documentation`** - Fetches current documentation from svelte.dev/docs for requested sections

**`svelte-autofixer`** - Static analysis tool that suggests fixes for generated code. Can run iteratively until all issues resolved

**`playground-link`** - Creates ephemeral playground URL with generated code (code stored in URL only, not on server)
